An exploration of browser-based circuit capture and simulation. 

Uses the MITx circuit simulation javascript files as a baseline. Appropriate copywrites to MIT maintained in original files.

Main contributions the base files include:
1) Style redesign
2) Workbench clipboards that allow for storage of multiple active circuit blocks
3) Persistent simulation window (i.e. not a popup)
	The goal of the persistent window is influenced by my desire to make the simulation a realtime experience. That is, the simulation updates as the circuit is edited in real time.
